In this course a code for computing the trajectory of a car was created.
Based on the braking and road conditions and the dimensions, weight distribution of a 1998 Honda Civic,
quantities such as pitch, roll, yaw, acceleration, velocity, sideslip, lockups and forces were computed.
I have included two pictures.
In one case as braking begins the car starts to spin.
In the other case the car must turn to achieve a trajectory around the two red dots.
